Forest fires are a common occurrence in both British Columbia and globally. In British Columbia, unprecedented amounts of forest have burned in the recent decades, with over 1,350,000 ha burning in 2018 alone, costing the Canadian government over $615 million dollars[@FF_data]. Due to the complexity and variability in landscapes, fuel characteristics, climate patterns, and man-made infrastructure, it is incredibly hard to determine how large a fire will be, the intensity at which it will burn, and how it will move. Predicting such fire characteristics would benefit local communities and may influence resource allocation decisions during fire events. Our aim is to create a machine learning model that can predict how much area a particular fire will burn. While our model will be simple, it will begin to explore the interactions between climate, soil properties, and area burned by forest fires.
