We have created a simple prediction model to explore how weather and soil moisture properties influence the size of forest fires. We explore a data set from northeastern Portugal that contains spatial features, temporal features, soil moisture indices, and weather features to predict the size of wildfires within the Montesinho natural park. We create a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model using the soil moisture variables along with temperature, relative humidity, wind, spatial coordinates, as well as season. After removing outliers using Cook's Distance method, we optimized our model using mean absolute area (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Our optimized model, with $C = 1.88$ and $\gamma = 0.48$, produces a MAE of 8.686  and a RMSE of 28.46 which is good for our range of area burned values from 0 to 1090 ha.
