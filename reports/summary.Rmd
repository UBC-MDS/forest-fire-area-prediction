We have created a simple prediction model to explore how weather and soil moisture properties influence the size of forest fires. We explore a data set from northeastern Portugal that contains spatial features, temporal features, soil moisture indices, and weather features to predict the size of wildfires within the Montesinho natural park. We create a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model using the soil moisture variables along with temperature, relative humidity, wind, spatial coordinates, as well as season. After removing outliers using Cook's Distance method
