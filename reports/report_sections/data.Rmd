For our simple prediction model, we have chosen a data set originally used in @Cortez_2007, which represents forest fire areas in Montesinho natural park located in the northeastern region of Portugal. The data, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (@Dua2019) (which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires)), was collected between 2000 and 2003 leading to 517 records.  It consists of two spatial features (x and y coordinates), two temporal features (month and day of the week), four soil moisture indices for different soil layers (FFMC (Fine fuel moisture code), DMC (duff moisture code), DC (drought code), and ISI (initial spread index)), and four climatic variables (temperature, rain, relative humidity, and wind). Each record in the dataset also has an associated area burned value. The burned area is highly skewed to smaller areas, with over 200 records recording no fires. Large fires occur less frequently than small fires, which explains the skewness, a phenomenon that is observed in countries globally [@Cortez_2007].
