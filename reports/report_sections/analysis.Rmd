The Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm was used to build a regression model to predict the burned areas of forest fires. The variables `FFMC`, `DMC` , `DC`, `ISI`, `temp`, `RH`, `wind`, `X`, `Y` and `season` were used to fit the model. The `day` and `rain` variables were dropped for the training, and the variable `month` was feature engineered into the `season` variable. Cook's Distance method with a threshold of $4/n$ was used to detect and remove outliers from the data set. The hyperparameters of $C$ and $\gamma$ were chosen using 10-fold cross-validation with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the regression metrics. The R and Python programming languages [@R; @Python] and the following R and Python packages were used to perform the analysis: pickle [@van1995python], docopt [@docopt], knitr [@knitr], NumPy [@2020NumPy-Array], Pandas [@mckinney2010data], statsmodels [@seabold2010statsmodels], scikit-learn [@pedregosa2011scikit], os [@Python], Matplotlib [@hunter2007matplotlib].
